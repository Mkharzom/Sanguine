            <p>Every day over 74 million people watch porn online, mostly oblivious to how their brains are negatively affected in the process. Collaborating with neuroscience educator Neurify, we launched a cutting-edge educational tool to change that. Utilizing data from thousands of MRI scans performed on porn addicts, The Porn Brain simulated userâ€™s dopamine rewards system based on their porn viewing history and habits. Users were then invited to learn about the ramifications of regularly watching porn, from reduced interest in romantic intimacy to lack of motivation to exercise. The Porn Brain also captured user data entries, identifying trends which were then delivered to agencies committed to tackling porn addiction.
