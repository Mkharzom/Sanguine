            <p>Every day over 120 million people watch porn online, oblivious to how their brains are negatively affected in the process. So we launched a novel interactive tool to educate the public on the neuroscience of porn consumption. Utilizing data from thousands of MRI scans performed on porn addicts, The Porn Brain simulated userâ€™s dopamine rewards system based on their porn viewing history and habits. Users were then invited to learn about the ramifications of regularly watching porn, from reduced interest in romantic intimacy to lack of motivation to exercise. The Porn Brain also captured data entries, identifying key trends which in turn were supplied to agencies tackling porn addiction.
